# Exploring Wikipedia in Python

One of the nicest things about working in a browser-based environment like 
Sense is that you can use rich, interactive web-based visualizations. 
The possibilities are endless; if a vizualization works in a browser, then 
you can write a function analogous to [matplotlib's](http://matplotlib.org/) 
`plot` that creates that visualization from your Python data in your Python 
session.

## Four awesome visualization libraries

Of course, some of those possibilities are easier to realize than others. This 
project will introduce you to four packages that bring web-based visualizations 
to your Python session in an especially Pythonic way: 
[bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html), 
[python-nvd3](https://github.com/areski/python-nvd3), 
[vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent) and the mapping package 
[folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium). We'll demo each package 
using a live dataset from Wikipedia, and you can get started experimenting with 
rich visualizations right away.
